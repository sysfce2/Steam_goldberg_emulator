// TF Inventory Position cracking

// REALLY OLD FORMAT (??):
//      Bits 17-32 are the bag index (class index + 999, 1 is unequipped).
//      Bits 1-16 are the position of the item within the bag.
//      0 means item hasn't been acknowledged by the player yet.
//
// LESS OLD FORMAT (up through July, 2011):
//		If Bit 31 is 0: 
//			Bits 1-16 are the backpack position.
//			Bits 17-26 are a bool for whether the item is equipped in the matching class.
//		Otherwise, if Bit 31 is 1:
//			Item hasn't been acknowledged by the player yet.
//			Bits 1-16 are the method by the player found the item (see unacknowledged_item_inventory_positions_t)
//		Bit 32 is 1, to note the new format.
//
// CURRENT FORMAT:
//		If Bit 31 is 0: 
//			Bits 1-16 are the backpack position.
//		Otherwise, if Bit 31 is 1:
//			Item hasn't been acknowledged by the player yet.
//			Bits 1-16 are the method by the player found the item (see unacknowledged_item_inventory_positions_t)
//		Equipped state is stored elsewhere.
//		This is the only format that should exist on clients.
// Note (1/15/2013) For backwards compatibility, if the value is 0 item is considered unacknowledged too
